               <p> The Republic of Korea is also more commonly known as South Korea. What is probably the most noticeable thing about the 
                Republic of Korea lately is their large musical influence around the world. </p>
                <p>The Republic of Korea has many famous companies that people know today. One of which would be Samsung, which started as a 
                    typical grocery chain before changing gears into the electronic, construction, and shipbuilding powerhouse that it has become
                today. <sub>1</sub> </p>
